## Update 1 - Feb 7, 2022

Found out about this game at 1:24am. Tried it at 1:25am. Hooked immediately and started coding it out a minute after.

Got the layout down of both the guess container and the keyboard container using CSS grid and hard coded some situational replicates.

    - When letter is in word and in the right position: green
    - When letter is in word but not in right position: yellow

When the keyboard is pressed, program recognizes what key is being pressed (logged into console). Woohoo!
